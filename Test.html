    Part One: Solidify Terminology 
In your own terms, define the following terms: 
What is HTTP?
HyperText Transfer Protocol - it is how browsers and servers communicate 
<p> What is a URL?
Uniform Resource Locator -  its the address that contains the content of a webpage</p>
<p>What is DNS?
Domain Name System - turns readable URL pieces into an IP address</p>
<p>What is a query string?
Provides additional info to the server for more specific search terms</p>
<p>What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
GET - retrieves info from servers
POST - sends info to servers </p>
<p>What is an HTTP request?
An HTTP request is a request from the browser to a server which follows the HTTP protocol</p>
<p>What is an HTTP response?
An HTTP response is a response from a server to the browser which follows the HTTP protocol</p>
<p>What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
Headers provide additional info from both the request and response -
Examples: Request - 
Hostname you’re asking about
Date your browser thinks it is
Language your browser wants information in
Any cookies that server has sent
Examples: Response - 
Content Type 
Date/time the server thinks it is
Any cookies server wants to set
Any caching information </p>


<p>What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
The browser changes the name into an IP address using DNS
The browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info about browser, any previous cookies, and other things)
The server sends a response (typically, HTML, with a status code (200 if it was successful))
The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc)
The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each </p>
